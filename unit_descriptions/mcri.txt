QMU Expression: mcri = curr/mflx

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: mcri

## Description
Represents the opposition or difficulty of establishing magnetic flux per unit of magnetic current.


## Relationships
- mcri = curr/mflx
- mcri = 1/magp: Where magp is magnetic permeance.


## Applications
- Analysis of magnetic current flow
- Study of magnetic flux establishment in materials
