# Quantum frequency (Fq)

## Symbol
Fq

## Description
The quantum frequency (Fq) is a fundamental unit of dimension in the QMU system, representing a characteristic frequency associated with quantum phenomena. It is closely related to the energy of quantum systems and plays a crucial role in describing the temporal behavior of quantum mechanical processes. The quantum frequency is essential in understanding phenomena such as wave-particle duality and the quantization of energy levels.

## Key Points
- Fundamental unit of dimension in QMU
- Represents a characteristic quantum mechanical frequency
- Essential in describing the temporal aspects of quantum phenomena
- Related to the energy of quantum systems through Planck's constant

## Relationships
- Used in combination with other base units (me, Î»C, eemax) to derive more complex units in the QMU system
- Plays a role in defining quantities such as energy, angular momentum, and action in quantum mechanics
- Connected to the concept of wave-particle duality

## Historical Note
The concept of quantum frequency emerged from the early development of quantum mechanics and has been crucial in understanding phenomena such as blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect.
