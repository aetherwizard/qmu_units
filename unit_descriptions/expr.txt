# Exposure (expr)

QMU Expression: expr = eemax2me

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: expr

## Description
Quantifies the amount of magnetic charge interacting with mass.


## Relationships
- expr = 1/mchg: Whereas mchg represents the mass-to-magnetic charge ratio of magnetism, the reciprocal of magnetic charge-to-mass ratio quantifies the effect of magnetism on physical matter.


## Applications
- Quantum magnetism studies
- Particle physics
