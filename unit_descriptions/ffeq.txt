# Flux Flow Equilibrium (ffeq)

QMU Expression: ffeq = meC3eemax4

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: ffeq

## Description
Describes a static condition of electrons in a conductor that transfers current to the magnetic field.


## Relationships
- mfld = curr*ffeq
- eddy = forc*ffeq: Eddy current is similarly related to flux flow equilibrium when a force is applied.


## Applications
- Electrodynamics
- Eddy current analysis
