QMU Expression: fric = meC3Fq2eemax4

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: fric

## Description
Represents the resistance to motion between two surfaces in contact.


## Relationships
- fric = resn*velc
- potn = fric*elcg: Friction times electric charge gradient is used in the APM to explain how potential is generated when rubbing a balloon to create electrostatic charge.


## Applications
- Electrostatic charge generation
