# Quantum Electric Charge Intensity (qeci)

QMU Expression: qeci = 1/(eemax2*Fq3)

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qeci

## Description
Represents the concentration or intensity of electric charge fluctuations in a quantum system, independent of spatial dimensions. It combines aspects of inverse magnetic charge and inverse cube of quantum frequency to describe the dynamic intensity of electric charge behavior at high frequencies.
