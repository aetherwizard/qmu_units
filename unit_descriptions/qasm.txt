# Quantum Aether Surface Oscillation Mobility (qasm)

QMU Expression: qasm = C2*Fq3/me

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qasm

## Description
Represents the surface oscillation mobility of a quantum system in the Aether relative to its mass. It quantifies the responsiveness of a quantum system's surface to high-frequency oscillations in the Aether per unit mass and describes the capacity of a quantum entity's surface to engage in intense oscillatory behavior within the Aether structure.
