# Force Density (fdns)

QMU Expression: fdns = me*Fq2/C2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: fdns

## Description
Represents the concentration of force within a quantum volume. It quantifies the intensity of force fields in three-dimensional space at the quantum scale and describes the spatial distribution of force within Aether units.


## Relationships
- fdns = forc/volm
- fdns = pres*wavn
- fdns = masd*accl


## Applications
- Analyzing the distribution of forces in quantum systems
- Characterizing the strength of quantum force fields in various contexts
- Studying the relationship between force, mass, and spatial scales in quantum mechanics
- Describing the intensity of interactions in quantum field theories
