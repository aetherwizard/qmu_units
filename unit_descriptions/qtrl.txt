# Quantum Trajectory Length (qtrl)

QMU Expression: qtrl = C*Fq2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qtrl

## Description
Represents the characteristic length of a trajectory traced by a quantum entity in space-time. It quantifies the spatial extent of motion for a quantum system over a given number of oscillations and describes the average distance covered by a quantum particle or wave during one period of its fundamental frequency.
