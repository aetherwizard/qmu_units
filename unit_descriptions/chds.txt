# Charge Distribution (chds)

QMU Expression: chds = C2*eemax2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: chds or strk

## Description
Represents the spatial extent of charge distribution over a quantum area. It describes how charge is spread out or concentrated in a two-dimensional quantum space, providing a measure of charge density in planar quantum systems.
