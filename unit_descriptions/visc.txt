# Viscosity (visc)

QMU Expression: visc = me*Fq/C

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: visc

## Description
Represents the resistance to flow or deformation at the quantum scale. It quantifies the internal friction within a quantum fluid or material and describes the rate of momentum transfer between adjacent layers of Aether units.


## Relationships
- visc = pres*time
- visc = forc*time/area
- visc = momd*leng
- visc = enrg*time/volm


## Applications
- Analyzing quantum fluid behavior and superfluidity
- Characterizing viscous properties of exotic quantum materials
- Studying energy dissipation mechanisms in quantum systems
- Describing quantum turbulence and vortex dynamics
