# Quantum Electric Field Compliance (qefc)

QMU Expression: qefc = eemax2*C3*Fq

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qefc

## Description
Represents the flexibility or adaptability of the quantum Aether substrate to accommodate electric field changes within a quantum volume at an even lower frequency scale than qefr. It combines aspects of charge, volume, and frequency to describe the underlying structure's compliance to gradual electric field variations.
