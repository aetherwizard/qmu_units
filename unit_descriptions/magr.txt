# Magnetic Rigidity (magr)

QMU Expression: magr = meCFqeemax2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: magr

## Description
Material's resistance to deformation by a magnetic field. Measuring magnetic rigidity helps characterize materials for applications like MRI machines, particle accelerators, and fusion reactors where strong magnetic fields are present.


## Relationships
- magr = mfld*bndr: Related to magnetic field (mfld) and bending radius (bndr).
- magr = mfxd*leng: Magnetic rigidity is measured in units of magnetic flux density (magnetic field strength), like tesla-meters.


## Applications
- MRI machines
- Particle accelerators
- Fusion reactors
- Material characterization
