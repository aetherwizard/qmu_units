# Magnetic Charge per Unit Potential (mcup)

QMU Expression: mcup = sfch/potn = magm*chrg/powr

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: mcup

## Description
Represents the amount of magnetic charge per unit of potential energy or power.


## Relationships
- mcup = sfch/potn: Where sfch is surface charge and potn is potential.
- mcup = magm*chrg/powr: Where magm is magnetic moment, chrg is charge, and powr is power.


## Applications
- Analysis of charge capacity in magnetic systems
- Study of charge efficiency in magnetic power systems
