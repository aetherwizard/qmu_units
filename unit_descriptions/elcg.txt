# Electric Charge Gradient (elcg)

QMU Expression: elcg = eemax2*C

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: elcg

## Description
Quantifies the rate at which the electric potential changes over a unit Compton wavelength in the Aether. It represents the spatial variation or gradient of the electric potential within the Aether.


## Relationships
- potn = elcg*fric: Relating electric potential to electric charge gradient and friction


## Applications
- Analysis of electrostatic potential generation by frictional forces
- Study of charge alignment and distribution in static electricity phenomena
- Investigation of electric potential propagation and storage in the Aether
