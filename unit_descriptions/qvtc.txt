# Quantum Volume Temporal Compliance (qvtc)

QMU Expression: qvtc = C3/(me*Fq2) = volm*qspr

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qvtc

## Description
Represents the susceptibility of a quantum volume to temporal fluctuations. It quantifies the combined effect of spatial extent and quantum spreadability on a volume's temporal adaptability and describes the spatiotemporal elasticity of a quantum system in response to frequency variations.


## Relationships
- qvtc = qvfi*freq
- qvtc = volm/(mass*rson)
- qvtc = spcv/rson
- qvtc = volm*qspr


## Applications
- Analyzing space compression effects in quantum systems of varying sizes
- Characterizing the temporal behavior of quantum fields in relation to their spatial spreading tendencies
- Studying the relationship between space, resonance, and quantum spreadability in quantum space density theories
- Investigating how quantum systems of different volumes respond to rapid changes in external frequencies
- Exploring quantum information propagation in both space and chronovibration
