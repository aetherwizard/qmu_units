# Quantum Charge Distribution Resistance (qcdr)

QMU Expression: qcdr = C2/(eemax2*Fq3)

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qcdr

## Description
Represents the resistance of a quantum system's charge distribution to rapid fluctuations. It combines the system's charge distribution (chds) with its quantum intensity resistance (qire), describing how the spatial arrangement of charge resists high-frequency changes.
