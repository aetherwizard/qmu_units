# Photon (phtn)

QMU Expression: phtn = me*C3*Fq2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: phtn

## Description
Represents a radially expanding burst of angular momentum in the Aether. It quantifies the transfer of angular momentum from an electron's orbital transition to the surrounding Aether.


## Relationships
- phtn = h*c
- phtn = irrd*vlmt


## Applications
- Analyzing the radial expansion of angular momentum in the Aether
- Characterizing the fundamental process of light emission in terms of electron orbital transitions
- Studying the relationship between irradiance and volume-time in photon propagation
- Describing the inverse square law of irradiance as a natural consequence of photon expansion
