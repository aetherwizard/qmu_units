# Electromagnetic Interaction Density (emid)

QMU Expression: emid = expr*chrg = chrg/mchg = magm/mflx = plsm/potn

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: emid

## Description
Represents the combined effect of electric charge and magnetic charge-mass interaction.


## Relationships
- emid = expr*chrg: Where expr is exposure and chrg is charge.
- emid = chrg/mchg: Where mchg is magnetism or magnetic charge.
- emid = magm/mflx: Where magm is magnetic moment and mflx is magnetic flux.
- emid = plsm/potn: Where plsm is plasma and potn is potential.


## Applications
- Analysis of electromagnetic field strength and distribution
- Study of electromagnetic energy density
- Investigation of electromagnetic stress and pressure
- Analysis of electromagnetic wave amplitude
- Study of plasma behavior and generation
