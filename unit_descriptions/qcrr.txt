# Quantum Charge Radius Resistance (qcrr)

QMU Expression: qcrr = C/(eemax2*Fq3)

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qcrr

## Description
Represents the resistance of a quantum system's charge radius to rapid fluctuations. It combines the system's charge radius (chgr) with its quantum intensity resistance (qire), describing how the radial extent of charge distribution resists high-frequency changes.

## Applications
- Analyzing the stability of charge radii in quantum systems under high-frequency perturbations
- Studying how one-dimensional or radially symmetric quantum structures maintain their charge configurations in dynamic environments
- Characterizing the robustness of radially distributed charge-based quantum states against rapid fluctuations
- Investigating the relationship between charge radius and high-frequency behavior in quantum dots or atomic systems
