# Inductance (indc)

QMU Expression: indc = meC2eemax2

SI Equivalent: Same unit as in MKS / SI

Shorthand: indc

## Description
Measures a coil's magnetic field strength.


## Relationships
- indc = areamchg: Related to area and magnetic charge.
- lengindc = curl2: Calculate the curl of a solenoid coil.
- indcleng = 2perm: Reciprocal of curl gives the number of turns of the coil.
- indc = 2Npermleng: Inductance of a coil in QMU.


## Applications
- Solenoid coil design
- Electromagnetic device design
