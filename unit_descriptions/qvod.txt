# Quantum Volume Oscillation Density (qvod)

QMU Expression: qvod = C3*Fq3/me

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qvod

## Description
Represents the density of quantum volume oscillations per unit mass. It quantifies the relationship between gravitational effects, frequency, mass, specific volume, and quantum intensity in systems and describes the intensity of spatial-temporal fluctuations in the Aether relative to mass and volume.
