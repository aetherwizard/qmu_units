# Electric Field Strength (elfs)

QMU Expression: elfs = meCFq2eemax2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: elfs

## Description
Equal to potential per length and reciprocal of capacitance times length.


## Relationships
- elfs = potn/leng: The electric field strength is the potential gradient measuring a specific potential at a specific distance.
- elfs = 1/(capc*leng): The electric field strength of a capacitor is reciprocal to the capacity of the plates and the thickness of the dielectric.
- elfs = forc/chrg: The electric field is traditionally explained as force per charge.
- elfs = efld*momt/volm: Electric field strength relates to the electric field when the electric field has momentum per volume of effectiveness.
- elfs*efld = resn*temp: When the electric field strength is applied to other electric fields, we get an insulation unit, which is equal to resistance times temperature.


## Applications
- Capacitor design
- Electrostatic force calculations
- Insulation properties
