# Diverging Electric Field (dvef)

QMU Expression: dvef = meFq2eemax2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: dvef

## Description
The diverging electric field has a unit of its own but in classical electromagnetism diverging electric field is strictly a mathematical operator. It equals the electric field strength per length and represents the electric field spreading out from a point source.


## Relationships
- dvef = elfs/leng: Related to electric field strength (elfs) and length (leng).
- dvef = mchg*rson: Diverging electric fields equals magnetism times resonance.


## Applications
- Quantum electrodynamics
- Field theory
