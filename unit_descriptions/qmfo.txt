# Quantum Mass Frequency Oscillation (qmfo)

QMU Expression: qmfo = me*Fq/C3 = masd*freq

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qmfo

## Description
Represents the product of mass density and quantum frequency. It quantifies the degree to which mass interacts with or occupies frequency states within the Aether structure.


## Relationships
- qmfo = masd*freq


## Applications
- Analyzing the behavior of matter in frequency-dependent quantum systems
- Characterizing the intensity of oscillations in various mass distributions
- Studying the relationship between mass and fundamental frequencies in quantum mechanics
- Investigating quantum phenomena that involve both mass concentration and frequency effects
- Exploring new models of particle behavior in quantum field theories
