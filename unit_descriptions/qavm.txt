# Quantum Aether Volumetric Flux Mobility (qavm)

QMU Expression: qavm = C3*Fq/me

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qavm

## Description
Represents the volumetric flux mobility of a quantum system in the Aether relative to its mass. It quantifies the responsiveness of a quantum system to volumetric changes or flow in the Aether per unit mass and describes the capacity of a quantum entity to engage in or respond to volumetric flux within the Aether structure.
