# Momentum Density (momd)

QMU Expression: momd = me*Fq/C2 = momt/volm

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: momd

## Description
Represents the concentration of linear momentum within a quantum volume. It quantifies the intensity of translational motion in three-dimensional space at the quantum scale and describes the spatial distribution of momentum within Aether units.


## Relationships
- momd = momt/volm
- momd = masd*velc
- momd = pres/velc


## Applications
- Analyzing the distribution of particle momentum in quantum systems
- Characterizing the intensity of quantum flows and currents
- Studying the relationship between momentum, mass, and spatial scales in quantum mechanics
- Describing the density of particle flux in quantum field theories
