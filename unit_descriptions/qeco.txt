# Quantum Electric Charge Oscillation (qeco)

QMU Expression: qeco = 1/(eemax2*Fq2)

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qeco

## Description
Represents the amplitude or strength of electric charge oscillations in a quantum system, independent of spatial dimensions. It combines aspects of inverse magnetic charge and inverse square of quantum frequency to describe the dynamic oscillatory behavior of electric charge at the quantum scale.
