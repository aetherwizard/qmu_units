# Quantum Electric Charge Fluctuation (ecfx)

QMU Expression: ecfx = 1/(eemax2*Fq)

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: ecfx

## Description
Represents the magnitude of electric charge variations or fluctuations in a quantum system over a single quantum time period, independent of spatial dimensions. It combines aspects of inverse magnetic charge and inverse quantum frequency to describe the basic dynamic behavior of electric charge at the quantum scale.
