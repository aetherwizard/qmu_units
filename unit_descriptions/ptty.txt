# Permittivity (ptty)

QMU Expression: ptty = eemax2meC3Fq2

SI Equivalent: Same as MKS / SI

Shorthand: ptty

## Description
Measures a material's ability to store an electric field.


## Relationships
- ptty = efxd/elfs: Related to electric flux density (efxd) and electric field strength (elfs).
- ptty = Îµ0*4: The QMU unit of permittivity is 4 times greater than the absolute permittivity of space.


## Applications
- Dielectric material characterization
- Capacitor design
- Electromagnetic wave propagation analysis
