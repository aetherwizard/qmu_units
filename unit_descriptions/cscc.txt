# Charge Surface Temporal Confinement Coefficient (cscc)

QMU Expression: cscc = time*sfch

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: cscc

## Description
Quantifies the temporal confinement or persistence of charge on a surface.


## Relationships
- cscc = time*sfch: Where time is temporal duration and sfch is surface charge.


## Applications
- Analysis of charge distribution dynamics
- Study of charged surfaces' stability
- Design of insulator and dielectric materials
- Development of electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection systems
- Optimization of charge transfer devices
