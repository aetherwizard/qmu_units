# Kinetic Friction (kfcn)

QMU Expression: kfcn = meC2Fq2eemax4

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: kfcn

## Description
Represents the rate of kinetic frictional force accumulation over a distance traveled.


## Relationships
- kfcn = fric/leng: It quantifies how quickly sliding friction builds up per unit length as surfaces move relative to each other.


## Applications
- Tribology
- Mechanical systems
