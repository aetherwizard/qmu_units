# Surface Charge Orbital Coefficient (scoc)

QMU Expression: scoc = me*C2*Fq2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: scoc

## Description
Represents the product of surface charge density and orbital time, or the ratio of surface charge density to resonance. It quantifies the relationship between surface charge distribution and quantum orbital or resonant behavior and describes how surface charge interacts with cyclic quantum processes in the Aether.

## Applications
- Analyzing the behavior of charged surfaces in quantum orbital systems
- Characterizing materials based on their surface charge properties in relation to quantum cyclic processes
- Studying quantum systems where surface charge effects interact with orbital motion or resonant behavior
- Investigating the relationship between surface electromagnetism and quantum periodicity in the Aether
