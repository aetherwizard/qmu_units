# Scalar Quantum Oscillation Density (sqod)

QMU Expression: sqod = Fq3/C

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: sqod

## Description
Represents the density of quantum oscillations along a linear dimension or path. It quantifies the rate of quantum fluctuations per unit length in the Aether and describes the intensity of quantum activity along a one-dimensional trajectory or line.


## Relationships
