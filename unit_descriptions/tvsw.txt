# Transverse Surface Wave (tvsw)

QMU Expression: tvsw = Fq/C2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: tvsw

## Description
Represents the frequency of quantum waves or oscillations per unit area on a surface or interface. It quantifies the density of wave phenomena in a two-dimensional quantum system and describes the rate of quantum fluctuations or oscillations occurring across a given surface area.


## Relationships

## Applications
- Analyzing the distribution of wave activity on quantum interfaces or surfaces
- Characterizing the density of quantum fluctuations on material boundaries or interfaces
- Studying the relationship between surface area and the frequency of quantum waves
- Describing the "surface wave activity" of different physical environments or states of matter
