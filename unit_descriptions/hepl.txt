# Helical Path Length (hepl)

QMU Expression: hepl = C*Fq3

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: hepl

## Description
Represents the characteristic length of a helical path traced by a quantum entity in space-time. It quantifies the spatial extent of orbital motion when considering both rotation and translation, and describes the average radius or total path length of quantum systems undergoing periodic motion in a moving reference frame.

## Applications
- Analyzing the behavior of quantum particles in complex orbital systems, like electrons in atoms moving through space
- Characterizing the effective "reach" or influence of quantum systems undergoing both rotation and translation
- Studying the coupling between different scales of motion in quantum phenomena, from atomic to galactic
- Describing quantum coherence lengths in systems with multiple, nested periodic motions
