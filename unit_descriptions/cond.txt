# Conductance (cond or Cd) (Conductance (cond or Cd))

QMU Expression: cond = eemax2meC2Fq

SI Equivalent: Same as MKS / SI

Shorthand: cond or Cd

## Description
Measures a material's ability to conduct electric current.


## Relationships
- cond = elfs*mfdi: Related to electric field strength (elfs) and magnetic field intensity (mfdi).
- cond = 1/mflx: Conductance is reciprocal to magnetic flux (not resistance).
- cond = eemax2/h: Conductance represents the magnetic charge per unit of angular momentum.


## Applications
- Electrical circuit analysis
- Material characterization
- Quantum conductance
