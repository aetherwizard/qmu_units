# Magnetic Flux Density Wave (mfdw)

QMU Expression: mfdw = meCFq2eemax4

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: mfdw

## Description
Represents the propagating flux concentration induced by moving magnetic charges.


## Relationships
- mfdw = mfxd*chgv: mfdw describes the wave-like behavior of magnetic flux density due to the motion of magnetic charges.
- mfdw = elfs*chrg


## Applications
- Electromagnetic radiation
- Magnetoplasma oscillations
- Diamagnetism
