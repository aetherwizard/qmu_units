# Quantum Charge Density Resonance (cdrs)

QMU Expression: cdrs = eemax2*Fq2/C3

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: cdrs

## Description
Represents the capacity of the quantum substrate to support resonant oscillations of charge density within a quantum volume. It combines the system's charge density (chgd) with its resonance factor (rson), describing how the volumetric concentration of charge interacts with resonant quantum processes.
