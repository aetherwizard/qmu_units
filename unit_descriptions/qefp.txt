# Quantum Electric Field Plasticity (qefp)

QMU Expression: qefp = eemax2*C*Fq3

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qefp

## Description
Represents the capacity of the quantum Aether substrate to undergo persistent deformations in response to electric field changes along a quantum linear dimension. It combines aspects of charge, length, and frequency to describe the underlying structure's ability to retain electric field-induced changes.
