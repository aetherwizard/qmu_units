# Quantum Charge Density Intensity (qcdi)

QMU Expression: qcdi = eemax2*Fq3/C3

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qcdi

## Description
Represents the intensity of charge density fluctuations within a quantum volume. It combines the system's charge density (chgd) with its quantum intensity factor (qinf), describing how the volumetric concentration of charge interacts with high-frequency quantum processes.
