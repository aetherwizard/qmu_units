# Compton wavelength (λC)

## Symbol
λC

## Description
The Compton wavelength (λC) is a fundamental unit of dimension in the QMU system, representing a characteristic length scale in quantum mechanics. It is defined as the wavelength of a photon whose energy is equal to the rest energy of the electron. The Compton wavelength plays a crucial role in quantum electrodynamics and is intimately connected to the quantum nature of matter and radiation.

## Key Points
- Fundamental unit of dimension in QMU
- Represents a characteristic quantum mechanical length scale
- Essential in quantum electrodynamics
- Related to the electron's rest mass and the speed of light

## Relationships
- Inversely proportional to the electron mass (me)
- Used in combination with other base units (me, Fq, eemax) to derive more complex units in the QMU system
- Plays a role in phenomena such as Compton scattering and pair production

## Historical Note
The Compton wavelength is named after Arthur Compton, who discovered Compton scattering, demonstrating the particle nature of electromagnetic radiation.
