# Magneto-Spatial Impedance Ratio (msir)

QMU Expression: msir = area/resn = magm/potn = sfch/mflx

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: msir

## Description
Represents a fundamental ratio that connects spatial, resistive, magnetic, and electric properties.


## Relationships
- msir = area/resn: Where area is spatial area and resn is resistance.
- msir = magm/potn: Where magm is magnetic moment and potn is potential.
- msir = sfch/mflx: Where sfch is surface charge and mflx is magnetic flux.


## Applications
- Analysis of magnetic materials
- Study of charge distribution in electromagnetic systems
- Investigation of impedance in electromagnetic systems
