# Magnetic Flux Intensity Ratio (mfir)

QMU Expression: mfir = eemax2meC3Fq

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: mfir

## Description
Represents the ratio of magnetic field intensity to energy density.


## Relationships
- mfir = mfdi/enrg: Magnetic field intensity (mfdi) quantifies the work a magnetic field can do. Energy density relates to the concentration and strength of energy in a region.


## Applications
- Characterizing and comparing the concentration of different magnetic field configurations
