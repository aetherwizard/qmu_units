# Magnetic Moment (magm)

QMU Expression: magm = eemax2*C2*Fq

SI Equivalent: J/T (Joule per Tesla)

Shorthand: magm

## Description
Measures the influence of the Aether's electrostatic charge against the magnetic charge of the subatomic particle.


## Relationships
- μe = (ge*magm)/(8π): For electron magnetic moment
- μp = (gp*magm)/(8π): For proton magnetic moment
- μn ≈ 1.001 * (gn*magm)/(8π): For neutron magnetic moment


## Applications
- Analysis of subatomic particle properties
- Study of magnetic interactions at the quantum level
- Investigation of nuclear magnetic resonance phenomena
