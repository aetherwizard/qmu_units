QMU Expression: efcd = eemax2*C*Fq

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: efcd

## Description
Represents the capacity of the quantum Aether substrate to facilitate the flow or transmission of electric fields along a quantum linear dimension. It combines aspects of charge, length, and frequency to describe the underlying structure's ability to conduct or propagate electric field changes.
