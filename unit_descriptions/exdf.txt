# Exposure Diffusion Flux (exdf)

QMU Expression: exdf = eemax2meCFq

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: exdf

## Description
Represents the diffusion and transmission of magnetism and charge as magnetic moment through the Aether via photons.


## Relationships
- exdf = magm*phtn: Exposure Diffusion Flux relates the exposure of the electron's intrinsic magnetism and charge to its diffusion through the quantum Aether at the velocity scale.


## Applications
- Quantum electrodynamics
- Photon-electron interactions
- Electromagnetic propagation
