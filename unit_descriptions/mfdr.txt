# Magnetic Field Resistance (mfdr)

QMU Expression: mfdr = 1/(chgr*mfxd) = curr/elfs

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: mfdr

## Description
Represents the magnetic field resistance per unit charge.


## Relationships
- mfdr = 1/(chgr*mfxd): Where chgr is charge radius and mfxd is magnetic flux density.
- mfdr = curr/elfs: Where curr is magnetic current and elfs is electric field strength.


## Applications
- Study of magnetic field behavior in various materials
- Analysis of magnetic resistance in electromagnetic systems
