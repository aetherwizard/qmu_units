# Transverse Surface Resonance (tvsr)

QMU Expression: tvsr = Fq2/C2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: tvsr

## Description
Represents the intensity of resonant phenomena across a two-dimensional surface or interface. It quantifies the density of resonant modes or standing waves in a planar quantum system and describes the capacity of a surface to sustain coherent oscillations at the quantum level.


## Relationships

## Applications
- Analyzing the distribution of resonant modes on surfaces or interfaces
- Characterizing the density of standing waves in two-dimensional quantum systems
- Studying the relationship between spatial scale and the capacity for coherent oscillations on surfaces
- Describing the "surface resonance capacity" of different physical interfaces or materials
