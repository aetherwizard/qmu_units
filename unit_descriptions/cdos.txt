# Quantum Charge Density Oscillation (cdos)

QMU Expression: cdos = eemax2*Fq/C3

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: cdos

## Description
Represents the fundamental oscillatory behavior of charge density within a quantum volume. It combines the system's charge density (chgd) with its fundamental frequency (freq), describing how the volumetric concentration of charge fluctuates at the most basic quantum timescale.
