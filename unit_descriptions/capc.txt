# Capacitance (capc)

QMU Expression: capc = eemax2meC2Fq2

SI Equivalent: Same as MKS / SI

Shorthand: capc

## Description
Measures a material's ability to store electric charge.


## Relationships
- capc = chrg/enrg: Capacitance is charge (chrg) stored as energy (enrg).
- capc = 1/potn: Capacitance is reciprocal to potential in QMU.
- capc = 1/(indc*rson): The reciprocal of inductance (indc) times resonance (rson) gives the internal capacity of the inductor.


## Applications
- Capacitor design
- Energy storage systems
- Circuit analysis
