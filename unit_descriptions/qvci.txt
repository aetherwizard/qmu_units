# Quantum Volumetric Charge Inertia (qvci)

QMU Expression: qvci = C3/(eemax2*Fq3)

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qvci

## Description
Represents the resistance of a quantum volume to rapid changes in its charge state. It combines aspects of quantum volume, inverse magnetic charge, and inverse high-frequency oscillations to describe the tendency of a three-dimensional quantum space to maintain its charge distribution against very rapid fluctuations.
