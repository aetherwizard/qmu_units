# Specific Charge (spch)

QMU Expression: spch = C3*eemax2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: spch

## Description
Represents the amount of quantum volume associated with a unit of magnetic charge. It describes the spatial distribution of charge within a quantum system, indicating how "spread out" or "concentrated" the charge is in three-dimensional quantum space.
