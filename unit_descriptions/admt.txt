# Admittance (admt)

QMU Expression: admt = chrg/mflx

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: admt

## Description
Represents the magnetic admittance, which is the ease with which magnetic flux can change in a system.


## Relationships
- admt = chrg/mflx: Where chrg is magnetic charge and mflx is magnetic flux.


## Applications
- Magnetic circuit analysis and design
- Calculation of magnetic loss and energy transfer
- Analysis of magnetic induction
