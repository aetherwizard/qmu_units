# Magnetic Charge Rotational Density (mcrd)

QMU Expression: mcrd = 1/(eemax2*C3)

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: mcrd

## Description
Quantifies the concentration of magnetic charge in relation to rotational and resonant phenomena. It represents the density of magnetic charge as it interacts with dynamic, rotating systems or high-frequency environments.


## Relationships
- mcrd = mchg/vrtx
- mcrd = mcpp/rson
- mcrd = qpmd*(freq)3
- mcrd = mfxd/rota


## Applications
- Analysis of astrophysical systems with strong rotational components
- Study of quantum-level magnetic resonance phenomena
- Investigation of high-frequency electronic and quantum devices
- Analysis of vortex-like structures in space and their interaction with magnetic fields
