# Temperature (temp)

QMU Expression: temp = C2*Fq2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: temp

## Description
Represents a quantum-scale measure of temperature in the Aether Physics Model. It combines a quantum area (C2) with a two-dimensional frequency known as resonance (Fq2), providing a novel perspective on thermal energy at the most fundamental level.
