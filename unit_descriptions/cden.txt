# Conductance Density (cden)

QMU Expression: cdns = eemax2C2Fq

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: cdns

## Description
Quantifies the density or concentration of conductance within a material or system.


## Relationships
- cdns = efxd*freq: Conductance density can be calculated by multiplying the electric flux density by the frequency.


## Applications
- Nanoscale electronic device design
- Quantum transport studies
- Material science research
