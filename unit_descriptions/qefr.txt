# Quantum Electric Field Receptivity (qefr)

QMU Expression: qefr = eemax2*C3*Fq2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qefr

## Description
Represents the capacity of the quantum Aether substrate to receive or accommodate electric field changes within a quantum volume at a lower frequency scale than qefs. It combines aspects of charge, volume, and frequency to describe the underlying structure's receptivity to electric field variations.
