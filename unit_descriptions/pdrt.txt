# Pressure Diffusion Rate (pdrt)

QMU Expression: pdrt = me*Fq3/C = ldns*qinf = pres*freq = visc*rson

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: pdrt

## Description
Represents the rate at which pressure or stress diffuses through a medium at the quantum scale. It quantifies the speed of pressure propagation or stress relaxation in a quantum system and describes the dynamic behavior of pressure waves or stress fields in the Aether.


## Relationships
- pdrt = ldns*qinf
- pdrt = pres*freq
- pdrt = visc*rson


## Applications
- Analyzing the propagation of pressure waves in quantum fluids
- Characterizing the stress relaxation times in quantum materials
- Studying the relationship between pressure, viscosity, and frequency in quantum systems
- Describing the dynamics of stress fields in the quantum vacuum
