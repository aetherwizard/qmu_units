# Quantum Electric Charge Displacement (ecdp)

QMU Expression: ecdp = 1/(eemax2*C)

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: ecdp

## Description
Represents the spatial shift or displacement of electric charge along a quantum linear dimension. It combines aspects of inverse magnetic charge and inverse Compton wavelength to describe the static displacement of electric charge in a one-dimensional quantum system.


## Relationships

## Applications
- Analysis of the spatial distribution of electric charges in quantum wire-like structures
- Study of charge separation in one-dimensional quantum systems
- Characterization of the static charge configuration in quantum devices
- Investigation of the interplay between electric charge displacement and magnetic effects in linear quantum structures
