# Quantum Electric Charge Acceleration (qeca)

QMU Expression: qeca = 1/(eemax2*C*Fq2)

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qeca

## Description
Represents the rate of change of electric charge velocity along a quantum linear dimension. It combines aspects of inverse magnetic charge, inverse Compton wavelength, and inverse squared frequency to describe the dynamic acceleration of electric charge in a one-dimensional quantum system.
