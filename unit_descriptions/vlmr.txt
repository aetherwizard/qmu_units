# Volumetric Resonance (vlmr)

QMU Expression: vlmr = Fq2/C3

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: vlmr

## Description
Represents the intensity of resonant phenomena within a given volume of space. It quantifies the density of resonant modes or standing waves in a three-dimensional quantum system and describes the capacity of a volume to sustain coherent oscillations at the quantum level.

## Applications
- Analyzing the distribution of resonant modes in quantum cavities or confined spaces
- Characterizing the density of standing waves in various quantum systems
- Studying the relationship between spatial scale and the capacity for coherent oscillations
- Describing the "resonance capacity" of different physical environments or materials
