# Converging Electric Field (cvef)

QMU Expression: cvef = eemax2meFq2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: cvef

## Description
Represents the tendency of the quantum Aether to draw energy, fields, and matter toward a central point.


## Relationships
- cvef = volm*Au: This structure gives cvef the proper dimensions to represent the inverse effect of the spreading, diverging electric field unit (dvef).


## Applications
- Quantum field theory
- Particle physics
- Cosmology
