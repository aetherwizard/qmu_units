# Pressure (pres)

QMU Expression: pres = me*Fq2/C

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: pres

## Description
Represents force per unit area at the quantum scale. It quantifies the intensity of force distribution over a surface within the Aether structure and describes the energy density in a quantum volume.


## Relationships
- pres = forc / area
- pres = enrg / volm
- pres = momd * velc
- pres = ldns * rson


## Applications
- Analyzing quantum vacuum energy density
- Characterizing stress in quantum materials and structures
- Studying the relationship between energy, force, and spatial scales in quantum mechanics
- Describing quantum fluctuations and their effects on spacetime
