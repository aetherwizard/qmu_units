# Magnetic Flux (mflx)

QMU Expression: mflx = meC2Fqeemax2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: mflx

## Description
Equal to sweep times magnetism.


## Relationships
- mflx = swepmchg: magnetic flux is sweeping magnetism.
- Î¦0/ccf = mflx2: Related to magnetic flux quantization in the quantum Hall effect.
- Z0 = mflx4: Related to space impedance.


## Applications
- Quantum Hall effect
- Impedance calculations
