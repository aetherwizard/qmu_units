# Quantum Angular Reach (qanr)

QMU Expression: qanr = me*C3*Fq

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qanr

## Description
Represents the three-dimensional distribution of angular momentum in quantum systems. It quantifies the "reach" or "influence" of a quantum particle's angular momentum over space.


## Relationships
- qanr = angm*leng
- magm = qanr*curl


## Applications
- Analyzing quantum vortex formation and behavior in superfluids and Bose-Einstein condensates
- Characterizing rotational properties of quantum systems, including spin and orbital angular momentum
- Studying quantum turbulence and vortex dynamics in quantum fluids
- Describing fundamental rotational aspects of particles and fields in quantum mechanics
