# Magnetic Field Energy (mfen)

QMU Expression: mfen = mfdi*cden = cond*chvl

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: mfen

## Description
Represents the energy associated with the magnetic field due to the flow of magnetic current.


## Relationships
- mfen = mfdi*cden: Where mfdi is magnetic field intensity and cden is conductance density.
- mfen = cond*chvl: Where cond is conductance and chvl is charge velocity.


## Applications
- Analysis of magnetic energy density in systems
- Study of magnetic power transfer
