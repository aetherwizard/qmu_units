# Quantum Aether Thermal Mobility (qatm)

QMU Expression: qatm = C2*Fq2/me

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qatm

## Description
Represents the thermal mobility or heat capacity of a quantum system in the Aether relative to its mass. It quantifies the thermal responsiveness of a quantum system in the Aether per unit mass and describes the capacity of a quantum entity to accommodate or transmit thermal energy within the Aether structure.
