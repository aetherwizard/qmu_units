# Resistance (resn)

QMU Expression: resn = meC2Fqeemax4

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: resn

## Description
Represents the opposition to the flow of electric current in a material.


## Relationships
- resn = potn/curr
- resn = mcur*indc: Magnetic resistance is also equal to magnetic current times inductance.
- Z = (potn/curr) + (mcur*indc): A possible impedance formula that can be tested.


## Applications
- Electrical circuit analysis
- Impedance calculations
