# Magnetic Permeance (magp)

QMU Expression: magp = meC2eemax4

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: magp

## Description
Represents the ease with which magnetic flux can be established in a material or system.


## Relationships
- magp = mflx/curr: Magnetic permeance depends on a material's magnetic properties, especially permeability.
- magp = 1/mrlc: magp is the reciprocal of magnetic reluctance (mrlc).


## Applications
- Magnetic circuit design
- Electromagnetic systems
