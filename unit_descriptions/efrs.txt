# Quantum Electric Field Resonance (efrs)

QMU Expression: efrs = eemax2*C2*Fq2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: efrs

## Description
Represents the capacity of the quantum Aether substrate to support and sustain resonant electric field oscillations across a quantum surface area. It combines aspects of charge, area, and resonance to describe the underlying structure's propensity for maintaining coherent electric field oscillations.
