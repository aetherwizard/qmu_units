# Acceptance (accp)

QMU Expression: accp = eemax2meCFq2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: accp

## Description
Represents the inherent attractive force between matter and Aether.


## Relationships
- accp = 1/elfs: Acceptance is the inverse of the elfs (electric field strength) unit.
- accp = chrg/forc


## Applications
- Casimir effect measurements
- Tests of short-range gravity-like forces
- Particle entanglement observations
- Lamb shift investigations
- Van der Waals and London dispersion force quantification
- Vacuum permittivity measurements
- Aether drag effect probing
- Gravitational anomaly testing
- Dark matter effect studies
