# Electron mass (me)

## Symbol
me

## Description
The electron mass (me) is one of the fundamental units of dimension in the QMU system. It represents the rest mass of an electron, which is a fundamental particle in physics. The electron mass is a crucial constant in quantum mechanics and plays a significant role in determining the properties of atoms and the behavior of electrons in various physical phenomena.

## Key Points
- Fundamental unit of dimension in QMU
- Represents the rest mass of an electron
- Essential in quantum mechanical calculations
- Influences atomic structure and electron behavior

## Relationships
- Used in combination with other base units (Î»C, Fq, eemax) to derive more complex units in the QMU system
- Plays a crucial role in defining the fine structure constant and other fundamental physical constants

## Historical Note
The precise measurement of the electron mass has been a subject of ongoing research in physics, with improvements in accuracy contributing to our understanding of fundamental particles and forces.
