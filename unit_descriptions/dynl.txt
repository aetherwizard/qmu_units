# Dynamic Length (dynl)

QMU Expression: dynl = C*Fq

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: dynl

## Description
Represents a characteristic length scale that evolves with the quantum frequency. It quantifies the spatial extent of quantum processes that are coupled to fundamental oscillations and describes a dynamic measure of distance in quantum systems that adapts to the system's intrinsic frequency.
