# Permeability (perm)

QMU Expression: perm = meCeemax2

SI Equivalent: Same as MKS / SI

Shorthand: perm

## Description
Measures a material's ability to support a magnetic field.


## Relationships
- perm = mchg/leng: Permeability is a quality of Aether unit that refers to the degree it can be penetrated or permeated.
- perm = 1/curl: Permeability is inversely related to curl and refers to the number of turns in a solenoid coil made from conductive material, especially in inductors.
- perm = mflx/velc: Permeability is the magnetic flux per penetrating velocity.
- perm = drag/mcdf: (see mcdf)


## Applications
- Magnetic material characterization
- Inductor design
- Electromagnetic shielding
