# Magnetic Volume (mvlm)

QMU Expression: mvlm = meC3eemax2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: mvlm

## Description
Quantifies the volume occupied by a magnetic field. Magnetic volume may be a direct unit for the phenomenon recognized as phonons.


## Relationships
- mvlm = volmmchg: Magnetic volume equals volume times magnetic charge.
- mvlm = mfldfreq: Magnetic volume is the magnetic field per frequency.
- Au = mvlmrson: A space quantum is a resonating magnetic volume (phonon).


## Applications
- Potentially related to phonons in solid-state physics
