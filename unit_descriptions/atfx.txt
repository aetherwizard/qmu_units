# Area-Time Flux (atfx)

QMU Expression: atfx = C2*Fq2 = area*orbt

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: atfx

## Description
Represents the flux of a quantum area through a complete orbital cycle. It quantifies the persistence or evolution of a two-dimensional quantum surface over one orbital period and describes the interplay between spatial area and cyclic temporal behavior.


## Relationships
- atfx = area*orbt


## Applications
- Analyzing the stability of two-dimensional quantum structures in cyclic systems
- Characterizing the coherence of surface states in atomic and molecular orbitals
- Studying the behavior of quantum Hall systems and other two-dimensional quantum effects
- Describing the spatial-temporal structure of standing waves on quantum surfaces
