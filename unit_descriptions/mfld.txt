# Magnetic Field (mfld)

QMU Expression: mfld = meC3Fqeemax2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: mfld

## Description
Represents the flow of magnetism in the Aether. The magnetic field is the whole volumetric flow of magnetism in the Aether, where the "flow" manifests in different modes.


## Relationships
- mfld = flowmchg: Magnetic charge equals flow times mchg.
- mfld = chrgdrag
- mfld = mfxdvolm: Magnetic field equals magnetic flux density times volume.
- mfld = currffeq: Flux flow equilibrium is important in electrodynamics.


## Applications
- Electrodynamics
- Current flow in conductors
