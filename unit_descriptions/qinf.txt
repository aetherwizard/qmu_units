# Quantum Intensity Factor (qinf)

QMU Expression: qinf = Fq3

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qinf

## Description
Quantifies the rate or intensity of quantum processes, particularly those involving energy transfer or field interactions at the most fundamental level.


## Relationships
- Present in the definition of power: powr = me*C2*qinf
- Appears in light intensity: lint = me*C*qinf
- Found in irradiance: irrd = me*qinf


## Applications
- Analyzing the intensity of quantum field interactions
- Characterizing the rate of energy transfer in quantum systems
- Studying the efficiency of quantum processes in various physical contexts
- Describing the "strength" or "vigor" of quantum phenomena in three-dimensional space
- Investigating the relationship between frequency and energy transfer in quantum electrodynamics
