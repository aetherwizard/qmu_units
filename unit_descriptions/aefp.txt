# Aether Fluctuation Potential (aefp)

QMU Expression: aefp = eemax2meC2

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: aefp

## Description
Represents the inherent capacity of the quantum Aether to produce virtual excitations and fluctuations.


## Relationships
- aefp = rson*potn: Significantly, aefp is the inverse of inductance (indc).


## Applications
- Quantum field theory
- Particle physics
- Cosmology
