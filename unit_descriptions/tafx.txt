# Temporal Area Flux (tafx)

QMU Expression: tafx = C2*Fq3 = area*orbt*time

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: tafx

## Description
Represents the flux of a quantum area through orbital and linear time dimensions. It quantifies the temporal evolution of a two-dimensional quantum surface and describes the interplay between spatial area, orbital cycles, and linear temporal progression.


## Relationships
- tafx = area*orbt*time


## Applications
- Analyzing the behavior of quantum surfaces in cyclic systems
- Characterizing the temporal evolution of two-dimensional quantum structures
- Studying the interaction between surface phenomena and complex temporal processes
- Describing quantum processes that involve both cyclic and linear temporal components in planar systems
