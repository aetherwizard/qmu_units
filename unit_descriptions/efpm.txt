# Quantum Electric Field Permeability (efpm)

QMU Expression: efpm = eemax2*Fq3

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: efpm

## Description
Represents the capacity of the quantum Aether substrate to allow the penetration and propagation of high-frequency electric fields, independent of spatial dimensions. It combines aspects of charge and frequency to describe the underlying structure's receptiveness to rapidly changing electric fields.
