## Applications
- Analysis of the quantum vacuum's "elasticity" in response to electric field stress in three-dimensional spaces
- Study of how the Aether substrate deforms under electric field influence in volumetric quantum systems
- Characterization of the "softness" or "hardness" of quantum volumes to electric field perturbations
- Investigation of the interplay between electric field compliance and magnetic phenomena in three-dimensional quantum systems
