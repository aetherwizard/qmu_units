# Quantum Aether Dynamic Intensity (qadi)

QMU Expression: qadi = C*Fq3/me

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qadi

## Description
Represents the resonant mobility of a quantum system through the Aether relative to its mass. It quantifies the responsiveness of a quantum system to resonant Aether interactions per unit mass and describes the propensity of a quantum entity to engage in resonant oscillations within the Aether structure.


## Relationships

## Applications
- Analyzing resonant quantum effects and their propagation through materials
- Characterizing the coherent quantum behavior of particles in the Aether
- Studying the relationship between mass and resonant quantum state evolution in the Aether
- Describing the "quantum Aether resonant responsiveness" of various particles or materials
