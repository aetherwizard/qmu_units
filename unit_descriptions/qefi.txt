# Quantum Electric Field Intensity (qefi)

QMU Expression: qefi = eemax2*C2*Fq3

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qefi

## Description
Represents the capacity of the quantum Aether substrate to support resonant electric field oscillations across a quantum surface area. It combines aspects of charge, area, and frequency to describe the underlying structure's propensity for sustaining coherent electric field fluctuations.
