# Quantum Surface Activity (qsac)

QMU Expression: qsac = me*Fq3/C2 = sfcd*qinf

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qsac

## Description
Represents the intensity of quantum activity on a surface area. It quantifies the rate of change or oscillation of mass distribution on a quantum surface and describes the dynamic nature of mass concentration on Aether unit surfaces over time.


## Relationships
- qsac = sfcd*qinf
- qsac = pres*sclw
- qsac = lint*volm


## Applications
- Analyzing the dynamic behavior of quantum surfaces in various systems
- Characterizing the energy flux across quantum interfaces
- Studying the relationship between mass distribution and frequency in surface quantum phenomena
- Describing the intensity of quantum fluctuations on material surfaces
