# Quantum Aether Angular Mobility (qaam)

QMU Expression: qaam = C2*Fq/me

SI Equivalent: Information not available

Shorthand: qaam

## Description
Represents the angular mobility of a quantum system through the Aether relative to its mass. It quantifies the rotational or sweeping responsiveness of a quantum system in the Aether per unit mass and describes the capacity of a quantum entity to undergo angular changes or rotations within the Aether structure.


## Relationships
