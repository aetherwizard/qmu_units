## Applications
- Analyzing quantum vortex formation and behavior in superfluids and Bose-Einstein condensates
- Characterizing rotational properties of quantum systems, including spin and orbital angular momentum
- Studying quantum turbulence and vortex dynamics in quantum fluids
- Describing fundamental rotational aspects of particles and fields in quantum mechanics

## Other Information
The Quantum Angular Reach (qanr) unit offers a unique perspective on how quantum angular momentum manifests in space. It suggests that the influence of a particle's spin or orbital angular momentum is not confined to a point but extends over a volume of space.
