# Admittance (admt)

## QMU Expression
admt = chrg/mflx

## SI Equivalent
Information not available

## Shorthand
admt

## Description
Represents the magnetic admittance, which is the ease with which magnetic flux can change in a system.

## Relationships

## Other Information
admt is analogous to electrical admittance in circuit analysis but specifically pertains to magnetic charge and flux. It is the inverse of magnetic impedance. A higher admt indicates magnetic flux changes more readily and depends on the magnetic properties of the material/system. Magnetically "soft" materials have higher admittance.
