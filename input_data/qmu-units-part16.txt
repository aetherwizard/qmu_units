## Applications
- Analyzing charge density distributions in two-dimensional quantum systems
- Studying how charge spreads out in planar structures like graphene, 2D electron gases, or quantum wells
- Characterizing the spatial extent of charge-based quantum states in layered materials
- Investigating the relationship between charge distribution and quantum confinement effects in 2D systems

## Other Information
This unit provides a fundamental measure of how charge is distributed in two-dimensional quantum space. It could be particularly useful in understanding phenomena such as electron distribution in 2D materials, charge accumulation at interfaces in heterostructures, spatial characteristics of quantum Hall states, and charge delocalization in molecular monolayers.
